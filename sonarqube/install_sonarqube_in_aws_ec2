AWS EC2 Instance Setup || Docker Installation || SonarQube Integration with Azure DevOps

Connect to your EC2 instance Log in to your AWS Management Console Select EC2 from the list of services Connect to your Ubuntu EC2 instance using SSH.

Install Docker on an Ubuntu EC2 instance on AWS Update the package list: Run the following command to update the package list:

sudo su
apt-get update -y
apt-get upgrade -y
Run the following command to install Docker

apt-get install -y docker.io
Verify the installation: Run the following command to verify that Docker is installed correctly:

docker --version This command should display the version of Docker that was installed.
To setup SonarQube on Docker, you can follow these steps: Pull the SonarQube Docker image by running the following command in your terminal:

docker pull sonarqube
Once the image is downloaded, you can create a container and start SonarQube by running the following command: This command creates a Docker container named "sonarqube" with the SonarQube image, and maps the container's port 9000 to the host's port 9000.

docker run -d --name sonarqube -p 9000:9000 sonarqube
Wait for a few minutes for the SonarQube server to start. You can check the logs of the container by running the following command:

docker logs -f sonarqube
docker ps (This command can be used to display the list of running Docker containers on your local system)
Once the server is up and running, you can access the SonarQube web interface by opening a web browser and navigating to http://PUBLIC-IP-OF-EC2:9000

By default, SonarQube requires a login. The default username is "admin" and the default password is "admin". You can change these credentials in the SonarQube web interface.
